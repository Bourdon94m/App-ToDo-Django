<h1 style="color: #3d59b3;">Short To-Do App with Django (WIP) 🚀</h1>

<p style="color: #3d59b3;">This repository showcases my learning journey in building a simple To-Do app using Django, emphasizing the iterative nature of software development. ✨</p>

<h2 style="color: #3d59b3;">Project Overview 📄</h2>

<p style="color: #3d59b3;">The initial goal was to create a basic To-Do app using Django, but during the process, I realized that a JavaScript approach would be more suitable. Despite its <span style="color: #ff9999;">🚧 incompleteness</span>, this repository serves as a testament to my learning experience. 📈</p>

<h2 style="color: #3d59b3;">Insights Gained 💡</h2>

<p style="color: #3d59b3;">Throughout the development, I gained valuable insights into the importance of aligning the technology stack appropriately. The frontend was developed using the sleek and customizable <span style="color: #729fcf;">💅 Tailwind CSS</span> framework, combined with Django, demonstrating my exploration of diverse technology stacks. 🎨</p>

<h2 style="color: #3d59b3;">Future Improvements 🛠️</h2>

<p style="color: #3d59b3;">Recognizing the current implementation's limitations, I plan to revisit this project to optimize the structure and adopt a more Django-centric approach. Leveraging Django's strengths, I aim to create a more robust and cohesive application, ready to take on any task. 💪</p>

<p style="color: #3d59b3;">Your Feedback is Welcome 🙏</p>

<p style="color: #3d59b3;">I eagerly welcome your feedback and suggestions as I continue to learn and refine my software development skills. ✨</p>
