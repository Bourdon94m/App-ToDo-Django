<h1>Short To Do App With Django</h1>
<p><i>Hello guys. I made a really short app with Django and Tailwind CSS. When you submitted and click on "add" it will add into the "box" </i></p>
<p><i>This apps isnt finish but the method that i use is more appropriate for Javascript. If i really would do it properly i was needed to stock it first in DB and only after shows it</i></p>
